### Description
The project is a tower defense game with co-op multiplayer capabilities. Each player will control a character in a 3D top-down game world. The players will start at a castle which they have to protect. The players have to collect resources in order to construct buildings. Buildings have mainly two purposes: They help you collect more resources or defend against the enemies. The enemies will constantly come to attack the castle, buildings or the players. They will sometimes attack in smaller groups or in bigger waves. In the course of the game, the enemies become stronger and stronger. Therefore, you need to upgrade buildings or train your character. This also requires more resources which can be accessed when you expand around you castle. Eventually, you will lose. The premise of this game is to find the best strategy to defend against the enemy as long as possible.
