# About Me

## Biography

"Many are my names in many countries. *Glanfaloth* among the Elves, *Yelan* to the Humans, *Choupi* I was in my youth in the Rivertown that is forgotten, my dog calls me *Woofwoof*, my cat calls me *Miaowmiaow*; I like to be called *Lanlan*."

I am a student at both [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html) and [42 Lausanne](https://www.42lausanne.ch/).
